# Spotify Popularity Predictor â€“ User Interface

This module provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to predict the popularity range of a song using a pre-trained neural network model. The prediction is based on audio features extracted from an MP3 file and a selected musical genre.

## How to Launch the Interface

To start the app, make sure you're in the project root directory and that your virtual environment is activated.

Run:

```bash
python Final_Project/user_interface/predict_gui.py
